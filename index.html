                <section class="Iowa-city">
                    In downtown Iowa City, the tired brick walls of local businesses have been given new life and are
                    now home to colorful, vibrant murals that passersby can’t help but notice. Created by Thomas Agran,
                    the director of public art for the Iowa City Downtown District (ICDD), the Mural Project aims to
                    bring artistic liveliness to the city’s downtown area, including its Pedestrian Mall, where
                    thousands of residents and students from the nearby University of Iowa campus traverse daily.

                    Scattered around downtown, like on the side of the Iowa City Public Library or hidden in an
                    alleyway, the most eye-catching of the murals rises 45-feet high and is full of brightly colored
                    flowers, bugs and animals. Dubbed Coexist, this mural is different than the rest, as it was designed
                    by artist Sayuri Hemann along with youth from the local United Action for Youth (UAY) program.

                    Ages 14 to 18, the youth collaborated with Hemann during brainstorming sessions to come up with the
                    Coexist concept, as well as painting the mural itself. While selected artists created the rest of
                    the murals, Agran modeled this particular mural off of an art program in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he
                    grew up. A core element of the Cincinnati program, Artworks, is youth employment, which sparked
                    Agran's idea of incorporating a similar tactic for Iowa City’s mural project.

                The paint might not even be dry on some of the featured murals when they make their debut at Blink on
                Thursday night.

                Agar was in charge of curating 16 new murals completed just in time for the light, art and culture
                event. Many of the artists began work on the creations in the past week and were continuing to work on
                them during the day on Thursday.

                The paintings join nine others that were created for Blink 2017.

                Local artists along with internationally known painters contributed to the mural lineup.

                    Mercedes-Benz USA is suing the artists Daniel Bombardier, Maxx Gramajo, James "Dabls" Lewis,
                    and Jeff Soto, whose murals appeared in photographs the company posted on Instagram in 2018.
                    The company claims the artists have threatened to sue for copyright infringement, and are
                    seeking a judge’s ruling asserting that the images do not constitute infringement.

                    The legal action revolves around photos posted on Mercedes-Benz’s Instagram profile in
                    January 2018 (that have since been deleted) promoting the automaker’s luxury sports utility
                    vehicle, the Mercedes G 500. The images were shot in Detroit’s Eastern Market, which has
                    become widely known for its Murals in the Market initiative, and where the defendants all
                    had murals. In its lawsuit, Mercedes-Benz, which had obtained permits for the shoot, claimed
                    that its images “fundamentally transformed the visual aesthetic and meaning” of the murals.

                    “We attempted to discuss the matter with [Mercedes-Benz], but instead, they sued us claiming
                    they did not violate any copyright laws and are asking the court to rule that we have no
                    rights against them,” Jeff Soto said in a statement sent to Artsy. Soto’s collaborative
                    mural with Maxx Gramajo appeared in the Mercedes-Benz photos.
